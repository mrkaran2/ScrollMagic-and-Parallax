# ScrollMagic-and-Parallax

There are five pages that demonstrates the following types of animations using ScrollMagic:

# 1. Navigation bar appears when a user moves to the second page
This is achieved by adding a new class to the navigation bar div.

# 2. Objects start floating to the top of second page
The staggering function of ScrollMagic is used for sequentially animating the floating objects.

# 3. Floating objects are pinned to the middle of second page
As the user scrolls through the second page, the floating objects are pinned to a specific position and then the pinning is released the the user reaches the third page.

# 4. Animated scrolling to a section of the web page
The link on the navigation bar performs a scrolling animation to reach a specific position on the web page. This position can be changed from the JS file.

# 5. Parralax as user moves to end of web page
The forth page in the web page shows a parallax example using ScrollMagic itself.
